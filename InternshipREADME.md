Python. For implementation of Python we’ve chosen jupyter notenook and google
collaburation because it’s easy to learn.Next day of internship I completed basic

lern introduction of Pandas.After learning of Pandas I done another case study(nifty.csv).Last
day of in this week I learn Serise and Dataframe.

on Planetary Dataset.Now I’ve learned new topic the topic nothing but Visualization and
Tabulation.
#Fourth week
The last week of the internship mainly I’ve learned Histogram and Barplots by applying datasets.
After that I’ve used Read Complex json files and Regression Problems.Applying dataset on Covid19
case study problems.My mentor was givin some Assignment Problems I’ve finished that assignment
